## NOTE

1. need Visual Studio 2019 to build native C++ project.
2. we can assocciate a new IME conext if game disabled it, but in fullscreen it will cause window to lose focus.
3. **node-gyp** need **python2** installed on system and make sure it's added to PATH

## run demo

1. git clone https://github.com/hiitiger/goverlay.git
2. run demo client
   - this includes the steps to build node native-addons `electron-overlay` and `node-ovhook`
   ```
       cd client
       npm link ../electron-overlay
       npm link ../node-ovhook
       npm i
       npm run compile:electron
       npm run build
       npm run start
   ```
3. click the start button to start overlay
4. start a d3d game, type its window name and inject

## inject a specific game

After you have the demo runs right

1.  copy files [`n_overlay.dll`, `n_overlay.x64.dll`, `injector_helper.exe`, `injector_helper.x64.exe`] from directory `game-overlay\prebuilt` to directory `node-ovhook\build\Release`
2.  run demo client
3.  click start button to start overlay
4.  start the game you want to inject to and wait for it game window to show
5.  input the window title(or part of the title) of the game, and click the inject button
